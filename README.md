## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]
I’m Here is an app that allows multiple groups of friends to message each other and share a map with their own locations in that instance of a group. They can also click the I’m here button and a message will appear in that group's chat of all the people in a .5 mile radius of the person who pressed the button.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:**
Productivity / Messaging / Social

- **Mobile:**
We plan to use it on an IOS mobile device.

- **Story:**
Users could join groups and see other people’s locations or even share their location to other people. There will be a chat box and to let people communicate. 

- **Market:**
Any person could use the app but to keep it safe, there will be an age restriction for children.

- **Habit:**
This app can be used at any time, but requires use from other users to see their location.

- **Scope:**
People will be able to join groups by invitation and after joining, they can see everyone in that group on that group’s map.
We would start implementing a location sharing app that people could form groups to share their location with.
